# Goal

The goal of this project is to provide a quick way to deploy documentation websites with the theming consistency of the Green Software Foundation doc websites. The difference between their websites though and ours is we pull in all the power of Quell including powerful page creator and module federation capabilities making it possible to embed other applications directly in our docs without dirty ole iframes. Also building pages compeltely in the browser without code changes and necessarily needing to redeploy unless pre-rendering is desired.

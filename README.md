# Summary

This project is a distro of [SPeaRhead](https://github.com/rollthecloudinc/spearhead) for building carbon free documentation focused websites that look nearly identical to the [Green Web Foundation](https://learn.greensoftware.foundation/) documentation websites. 

Carbon free websites are built by combining [HEDGE](https://github.com/rollthecloudinc/hedge) with [Quell](https://github.com/rollthecloudinc/quell) aka: SPeaRhead. Carbon free websites will also combine front and back end emissions with a call to action to contribute to offseting. Carbon free websites also use the very well known [TailWindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) utility lib making theming a pleasure and breeze.

Carbon Free website pages can be published and edited directly in the same application using our low code editor Quell. Editing within the same app eliminates all emissions that would otherwise occur from third party apps like Github.

Carbon free websites track and monitor real time electricity and emissions using the Cloud Jewels formula adjusted for grid carbon intensity of back-end cpu processing when publishing and editing pages using Quell. Emissions data is recorded inside [AWS Open search](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/) bringing the full power of AI and machine learning to our finger tips against this data. AI and machine learning can be used to learn about carbon free app emissions to reduce and offset via real time actionable intelligance.

# Features

## In Place Editor – [Quell](https://github.com/rollthecloudinc/quell)

Publish and edit pages directly in the browser without additional page loads never leaving the site.

## SCI – Software Carbon Intensity Tracking

Tracks both front and back end emissions. Logs back-end SCI inside AWS Open Search. Once in open search data can be analyzed for opporunities to reduce emissions and purchase offsets.

## Dev Tools Styling

Spearhead Docs are styled using Tail Wind CSS. Browser dev tools can be used to add Tail Wind CSS classes to customize pages. Classes added within the dev tools are retained and applied to future page loads.

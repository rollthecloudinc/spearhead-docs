# Summary

SPeaRhead is a starter kit for quickly building and deploying low energy sustainable websites. SPeaRhead is equipped with [Quell](https://github.com/rollthecloudinc/quell) for rapid creation of low code web experiences also supporting hybrid app creation using multiple JavaScript frameworks. SPeaRhead uses [emissionless](https://github.com/rollthecloudinc/emissionless) Octostore to search, save data and HEDGE to maximize clean energy use. SPeaRhead is built on top of the tried and true ever evolving Angular framework for modern front-end web development and serverless climate respectful APIs based on AWS well architected framework sustainability pillar.

# Goal

The goal of this project is to provide a quick way to deploy documentation websites with the theming consistency of the Green Software Foundation doc websites. The difference between their websites though and ours is we pull in all the power of Quell including powerful page creator and module federation capabilities making it possible to embed other applications directly in our docs without dirty ole iframes. Also building pages compeltely in the browser without code changes and necessarily needing to redeploy unless pre-rendering is desired. This spearhead will also provide tailwind support and inline browser editing of html classes via inspector and retained upon page reloads. The complete package built with sustainability at the forefront from front-end to back-end on the rtc carbonfreeed platform.

The goal is to make the appearance match EXACTLY the green software foundation docs but instead of being powered by docusaurus quell, emissionless will run everything on the carbonfreed web back to front.

We should also have the option available to run these sites without JavaScript at all making for one of the most powerful, lightweight doc websites on the web that is carbon free / optimized.

# Summary

This project is a distro of [SPeaRhead](https://github.com/rollthecloudinc/spearhead) for building carbon free documentation focused websites that look nearly identical to the [Green Web Foundation](https://learn.greensoftware.foundation/) documentation websites. 

Carbon free websites are built by combining [HEDGE](https://github.com/rollthecloudinc/hedge) with [Quell](https://github.com/rollthecloudinc/quell) aka: SPeaRhead. Carbon free websites will also combine front and back end emissions with a call to action to contribute to offseting. Carbon free websites also use the very well known [TailWindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) utility lib making theming a pleasure and breeze.

Carbon Free website pages can be published and edited directly in the same application using our low code editor Quell. Editing within the same app eliminates all emissions that would otherwise occur from third party apps like Github.

Carbon free websites track and monitor real time electricity and emissions using the Cloud Jewels formula adjusted for grid carbon intensity.
